Yggdrasil is a versatile ready to use backend.

Currently, this project is in early alpha, need unit tests, documentation and some refactor.
DO NOT USE AS IS !!!!

## Start in dev  mode : 

You will need to have Docker and Docker-compose installed and configured.

```bash
./start-dev
```

This will launch the server stack (redis, mongo, backend) via docker (killing existing containers if needed)

The server is started when you see this : 

```
backend    | time: ‚è±  Starting Server took: 747.483ms
backend    | info: ü§ò  Yggdrasil is up and running !

```

## Testing

### Unit tests only

Just run `npm run test:unit`

The unit test coverage details information are located in the coverage dir.

The tests are performed by [mocha](https://mochajs.org), and use [sinon](https://sinonjs.org), [should](https://shouldjs.github.io) and [rewire](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rewire).

### Functional tests only

Just run `npm run test:func`

The functional test coverage details information are located in the coverage.functional dir.

The tests are performed by [cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js)

You need to perform the tests directly into the /var/yggdrasil directory onto the docker container or just have a started stack (the npm command is smart enough to launch the tests into the container by itself).

### Unit and Functional tests

You first need to have a docker stack running, then use the `npm test` command.

The coverage reporter is [istambujs/nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc)

## Features

### Configuration

Yggdrasil uses the [defaultConfig.json](./defaultConfig.json) file as a configuration base.

As Yggdrasil uses the [rc module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rc), you can also use your very own configuration, via : 

- command line arguments, parsed by minimist (e.g. --foo baz, also nested: --foo.bar=baz)
- environment variables prefixed with ${yggdrasil}_
  - or use "__" to indicate nested properties (e.g. yggdrasil_foo__bar__baz => foo.bar.baz)
- a local .${yggdrasil}rc or the first found looking in ./ ../ ../../ ../../../ etc.
- $HOME/.${yggdrasil}rc
- $HOME/.${yggdrasil}/config
- $HOME/.config/${yggdrasil}
- $HOME/.config/${yggdrasil}/config
- /etc/${yggdrasil}rc
- /etc/${yggdrasil}/config

### OAuth Strategies

The currently supported OAuth strategies are: Google, Facebook, GitHub, Microsoft and Twitter.

See [OAuth Strategies Readme](./lib/businessObjects/repositories/AuthRepository/OAuthStrategies) for further details.

### HTTP & SocketIO

Yggdrasil serves HTTP routes via the good old [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) framework along with a
[SocketIO](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socketio-server) server.

Both of them are secured by an authorization system based on [JWT](https://jwt.io/);

By default, all routes ans SocketIO accesses requires the JWT token to be present (and valid) except the ones used to sign-in, re-create a password, or public files

### Data storage

Yggdrasil uses Mongo as primary storage and Redis for cache.
Everything is put in Redis then Mongo so that yggdrasil can absorb a huge amount of calls.

Redis is also used to store user sessions.

### File storage

By default, the local strategy is used, and the files are stored into the container where Yggdrasil lives.
A S3 storage strategy is in development.

## Troubleshoot

### I have dirty docker images and volumes

Clean your docker environment :

```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
docker network prune -f
docker rmi -f $(docker images --filter dangling=true -qa)
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls --filter dangling=true -q)
docker rmi -f $(docker images -qa)
```

### Mongo is in a dirty mess after a system crash

In case of a system crash, some mongoDB data files could be irremediably corrupted. To get a clean stack, just do
* `docker-compose -r docker-compose/dev.yml kill `
* `sudo rm -rf /data/mongo`
* restart the stack
* launch the `./mongoRestore` script
* enjoy your day
