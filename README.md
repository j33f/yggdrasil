Yggdrasil is a versatile ready to use backend.

Currently, this project is in early alpha, need unit tests, documentation and some refactor.
DO NOT USE AS IS !!!!

## Start in dev  mode : 

```bash
./start-dev
```

This will launch the server stack (redis, mongo, backend) via docker (killing existing containers if needed)

The server is started when you see this : 

```
backend    | time: ‚è±  Starting Server took: 747.483ms
backend    | info: ü§ò  Yggdrasil is up and running !

```

## Testing

### Unit tests only

Just run `npm run test:unit`

The unit test coverage details information are located in the coverage dir.

The tests are performed by mocha, and use [sinon](https://sinonjs.org), [chai](https://www.chaijs.com) and [should](https://shouldjs.github.io).

### Functional tests only

Just run `npm run test:func`

The functional test coverage details information are located in the coverage.functional dir.

The tests are performed by [cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js)

You need to perform the tests directly into the /var/yggdrasil directory onto the docker container or just have a started stack (the npm command is smart enough to launch the tests into the container by itself).

### Unit and Functional tests

You first need to have a docker stack running, then use the `npm test` command.

The coverage reporter is [istambujs/nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc)

## Mongo Dump/Restore
```bash
./mongoDump

./mongoRestore
```

## Troubleshoot

### I have dirty docker images and volumes

Clean your docker environment :

```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
docker network prune -f
docker rmi -f $(docker images --filter dangling=true -qa)
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls --filter dangling=true -q)
docker rmi -f $(docker images -qa)
```

### Mongo is in a dirty mess after a system crash

In case of a system crash, some mongoDB data files could be irremediably corrupted. To get a clean stack, just do
* `docker-compose -r docker-compose/dev.yml kill `
* `sudo rm -rf /data/mongo`
* restart the stack
* launch the `./mongoRestore` script
* enjoy your day
